# Galaxy-Raiders

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create the game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to move the ship and fire bullets, randomly generate space invader aliens and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the bullets and aliens, and add a running score. In addition, you will learn how to reset the game and randomly generate aliens of different colors every time a set of aliens have been cleared.
